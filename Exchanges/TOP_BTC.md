## What do you need for voting?

Only holders of TOPB, the excahnge token, are able to vote.  
If you have a new account there, you have no TOPB, so you need to buy some.  
ETH/TOPB pair is ok.

### Deposit ETH

- Go to finance / Deposit, 
- select ETH
- click to get your deposit address

Read the voting rules, I wrote here what I understood, but check by yourself.

### Free voting

- 1 Vote per TOPB in your account
- TOPB will be help from your account until the end of the voting week, then will be returned whatever BIS won or not.

### Paid voting

- 100 votes per TOPB. That is, 1 vote means minus 0.01 TPB in your account. If you have 1000 TPB, you can set 100000 votes on the bismuth line.
- paid votes TOPB will be returned if BIS does *not* win.
- paid votes will *not* be returned if BIS win, but instead you may get rewards in BIS as airdrop for voters (To be announced)

## Conclusion

This is a rare opportunity to be listed on a top exchange.  
Even if BIS is not listed this week, TOPB wil lbe returned and we will have more luck next week.  
So please, show you really want $BIS listed on good exchange and take some of your time to register with our link (no cost to you) and better, if you can afford and want to help bis, free (returned) or paid votes for BIS.

Thank you!
