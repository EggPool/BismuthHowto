# What is an Egg or $egg?

## The Bismuth Token

$egg is a Bismuth token Eggpool registered for future use.   
They gave some to early miners, and now via a giveaway twice a day for eggpool miners.  

$egg was of no practical use until @Iyomisc showed his dragginator draft.  
EggPool gave him 10k $egg for his usage, we are trying to promote the app, and we agreed that 1 $egg would allow for one dragginator egg, whatever the dragginator price would be.

So, for now, only way to have an $egg (the bismuth token) is from Iyomisc giveways (I think more will come) and from eggpool's giveway.

Now, If you have a serious app on top of Bismuth you'd like to promote, or can run a popular giveaway/contest and need some prizes, maybe we can break some eggs ;)

## Other $egg

We were told about $egg, a recent ERC20 token found on yobit.
This $egg is not the same token, uses another blockchain (ETH), and is then completely unrelated.
