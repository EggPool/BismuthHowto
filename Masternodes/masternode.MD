# Bismuth Masternodes

Yeah, everyone wants to have a Bismuth masternode.  
Since those are very different from other masternodes, they are called "HyperNodes".  
Latest update of this doc : August 3, 2018.

## When masternode?

No kidding, with "When more exchanges", it's a really really frequent question.

No official ETA Yet, but things move fast.

## How much will a Masternode cost?

There were rumors of 10 000 BIS, and the official twitter once said "We don't know yet, but it will not be lower than 10K Bis".  
It has now be officially announced: Minimum colalteral is 10K $BIS.  
But you can also - with a single HyperNode install - freeze 20K or 30K and then get 2x or 3x the rewards.

## What will I earn with a Bismuth Hypernode?

ROI, profitability scenarios To Be Announced.

## What will the technical requirements for a Hypernode be?

## What do we know?

* HN will operate on a separate PoS chain
* The PoS chain has no currency, it's used to collect metrics and do stats/validation/provide services.
* The HN will also act as a "cutting edge" real world test bench, with new techniques being tested.
* HN are still funded by BIS collateral, no new currency, no change for users/wallets/exchanges.

* The mining algo and PoW chain won't change. But a more recent/secure hash could be used for PoS chain hash and signatures.

Quoted from bitcointalk thread:

> To clarify the MN approach:
> 
> - MN will still need Bis collateral and rewards will be paid in BIS
> - A technical paper with strategy and details will come later, it's too soon right now
> - A PoS chain, as a second level, will allow MN to reach consensus independently from the Bis PoW chain.
> - Nothing will change for Bis, Users or miners. Bis and balances will stay on PoW chain.
> - The two levels operating on two different strategies allow to highly strengthen and secure the network, since an attack would have to forge 2 chains with very different triggers.
> 
> So the MN implementation will not just be a "ping" test like on some coins, but would embed, from the start, innovative and secure algorithms.
> All this is being evaluated, coded, documented, tested by the team.
