# Bismuth Masternodes

Yeah, everyone wants to have a Bismuth masternode.

## When masternode?

No kidding, with "When more exchanges", it's a really really frequent question.

No ETA Yet.
Masternodes are still at early developpment stage, no features nor requirements are announced yet.

## How much will a Masternode cost?

Nothing was officially announced.  
There are rumors of 10 000 BIS, and the official twitter once said "We don't know yet, but it will not be lower than 10K Bis".

## What will I earn with a Bismuth Masternode?

Dunno.
Nobody knows yet.

## What will the technical requirements for a masternode be?

Dunno.
Nobody knows yet.

## What do we know?

* MN will operate on a separate PoS chain
* The PoS chain has no currency, it's used to collect metrics and do stats/validation/provide services.
* The MN will also act as a "cutting edge" real world test bench, with new techniques being tested.
* MN are still funded by BIS collateral, no new currency, no change for users/wallets/exchanges.

* The mining algo and PoW chain won't change. But a more recent/secure hash could be used for PoS chain hash and signatures.

Quoted from bitcointalk thread:

> To clarify the MN approach:
> 
> - MN will still need Bis collateral and rewards will be paid in BIS
> - A technical paper with strategy and details will come later, it's too soon right now
> - A PoS chain, as a second level, will allow MN to reach consensus independently from the Bis PoW chain.
> - Nothing will change for Bis, Users or miners. Bis and balances will stay on PoW chain.
> - The two levels operating on two different strategies allow to highly strengthen and secure the network, since an attack would have to forge 2 chains with very different triggers.
> 
> So the MN implementation will not just be a "ping" test like on some coins, but would embed, from the start, innovative and secure algorithms.
> All this is being evaluated, coded, documented, tested by the team.
