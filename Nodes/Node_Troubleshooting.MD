# Bismuth Nodes Troubleshooting

## Can't Sync!

Checklist :

- 5658 port is open, no firewall, I can check it's available from the internet. for instance : https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/

Config.txt file:
- config.txt, or config_custom.txt if you use it: I have at least 50 threads `thread_limit=75` is fine.  
- I have nothing in banlist  
- I have bp1.eggpool.net in whitelist (may help getting sync)  

- close and relaunch

If block height does not move, and you are behind (check http://bismuth.online for a live reference)

- close node
- delete peers.txt, and replace by this file (official peers.txt from 4.2.1.9)
https://github.com/hclivess/Bismuth/raw/4.2.1.9/peers.txt
- relaunch node

## Innocuous log messages
