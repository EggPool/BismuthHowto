# Bismuth Wallet Issues?

##Â Windows / Linux

### "Wallet cannot connect to the node"
"check config.txt for light_ip"

You wallet has to be connected to a node.  
By default, the node it connectes to is your own machine, 127.0.0.1

So, you have to also run the node on your machine, then your wallet will connect.


## Sending to Cryptopia

- recipient: paste cryptopia address
- amount: how many BIS to transfer
- data: enter your personal cryptopia code
- no need to tick "message" box
- hit "send" and confirm.

- You can chheck the transaction went through after a while, via http://bismuth.online

### When I try to send my mined bismuths to cryptopia. It says invalid adress
- Double check you didn't paste a space at beginning or end of the address
